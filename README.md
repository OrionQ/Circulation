# Circulation
Circulation is a virtual installation that accentuates our emotional connections with nature and visualizes it's reactions to our presence. Our goal is to have the participants leave with a deeper understanding of our place on this Earth as a single part of a greater nature. (Adapted from Chutong Fang)
